The community team at the Hiero Python SDK have been working behind the scenes since November 2024 to help Python developers plug into Hedera’s decentralized network using Python code. 

If you’re interested in helping us grow our SDK codebase and documentation this July—whether you’re a smart‑contract wizard or just dipping your toes into technical aspects—we’re striving to create a welcoming spot for you. 

Here’s how you can roll up your sleeves, gain skills, and help our SDK blossom:

---

## 🚀 What’s Going On?

We’ve built strong functionality around consensus, queries, transactions, tokens, and our file‑service features are speeding ahead. Now, we’re setting our sights on the next frontier: Smart Contracts.

- **Experienced developers**: Dive into smart contract logic using Python—design and implement the next wave of  
  `ContractUpdateTransaction`, `ContractDeleteTransaction`, `ContractExecuteTransaction`, and more.  
- **New developers**: Check out our “Good First Issues” for tasks like linting, type hinting, and test‑setup guides.  
  We also have opportunities to work on GitHub Actions, node handling, and key management.

---

## 🔧 Hands‑On Tasks

### For Experienced Developers
- **Add new contract transactions**  
 Pick up issues like [#200 Add ContractDeleteTransaction](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/200) and shape how contracts are created.
- **Audit & strengthen**  
 Tighten branch protections and CI best practices (issues [#192](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/192), [#194](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/194)).

### For Newcomers
- **Linting & typing**
  - Research adding Mypy to GitHub Actions ([#191](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/191))
  - Tackle “Good First Issues” in modules like `crypto`, `client`, `consensus`, and more (e.g. [#189](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/189) ▶ [#184](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/184))
- **Refactor for readability**
  - Introduce type hints, simplify APIs, and clean up docstrings (for example, [#124](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/124))
- **Boost our docs**
  - Improve README files, expand setup instructions, and write clear examples so future members can hit the ground running (issues [#178](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/178), [#113](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/113))

## 🎓 Learning & Collaboration

Our support network is growing—you won’t feel alone. Join us to ask questions, brainstorm, and celebrate Python:

- **Fortnightly Community Call**  
  Every two weeks on Wednesdays at **2 PM UTC**  
  Chat about progress, propose features, and meet fellow contributors.

- **Weekly Office Hours** *(coming soon!)*  
  Weekly on Tuesdays at **6 PM UTC**, starting July 29th. 
  Bring your blockers—we’ll help you debug PRs, configure environments, and hit the ground running.
